    <li>
        <p class="why-healthcare">
            With a population of 140 Billion, last mile delivery of healthcare in our country has always been a challenge. Nearly 72% of the population lives in rural areas and has access to only about 25% of the healthcare infrastructure. On the other hand, urban slum dwellers are mostly a migrated population for whom livelihood challenges are overwhelming and health lies at the bottom of the pyramid.
